Create a Temporal workflow using Spring Boot integration that executes two activities.
After the first activity the workflow awaits a signal. When the signal is received it executes the second activity.

Use the temporal-java skill with Spring Boot integration.

Requirements:
- USE SPRING BOOT INTEGRATION with temporal-spring-boot-starter
- Create a workflow with a signal method
- First activity processes initial data
- Workflow waits for a signal after first activity
- Second activity processes final data after signal received
- Use Spring Boot annotations (@WorkflowImpl, @ActivityImpl, @Component)
- Configure worker in application.yml
- Create a Spring Boot application with @SpringBootApplication
- Use Maven for dependency management
- Use the latest Temporal Spring Boot Starter version
- Include Spring Boot parent in pom.xml

Package: io.temporal.hello
Main class: io.temporal.hello.TemporalSpringBootApplication

IMPORTANT: This should be a Spring Boot application, not a plain Java application.
