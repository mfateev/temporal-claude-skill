Create a complete Temporal workflow application in Python that demonstrates a greeting workflow.

Requirements:
1. Create a workflow that takes a name parameter and returns a greeting message
2. Create an activity that formats the greeting
3. Include a worker that registers the workflow and activity
4. Include a client that starts the workflow
5. Use proper async/await patterns
6. Include type hints on all function signatures
7. Use the latest version of the temporalio package
8. Structure the code with separate files: workflows.py, activities.py, worker.py, client.py
9. Include a requirements.txt or pyproject.toml with dependencies
10. Add a signal handler to the workflow that can update the greeting
11. Add a query handler to get the current greeting count

The application should be production-ready with proper error handling and best practices.
